            <li>This is a three-hour practice coding contest where you can polish your computer programming
                skills.</li>
            <li>Each contest consists of 5 problems of varying difficulties to test
                your skills.</li>
            <li>The problems are randomly selected from the past CodeChef Cook-Offs.</li>
            <li>You can create/participate in only one practice contest (of either of the three categories) at any
                instant of time.</li>
            <li>All the instructions and rules of a CodeChef Cook-Off are applicable in the practice contest.</li>
            <li>We believe that it is alright to refer to tutorials, books and other materials, learn a concept
                and
                then apply the same to solve a problem during a practice contest. But it is not alright to copy other
                people&#39;s solutions or seek other people&#39;s help to solve a problem without understanding
                it.</li>
            <li><b>Since, v1.0 of CodeChef API does not provide us with the option to 'submit' problems on behalf of users,
                    please have a look at the following video
                    to understand how one is required to submit her/his solution to a problem.</b>
